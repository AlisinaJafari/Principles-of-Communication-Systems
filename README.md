# Computer Assignment 3 - Principles of Commuinication Systems

In this assignment the second half contents of the course will be discussed . There are 3 parts in this project . First one is about statistics specifically Rayliegh destribution . We are going to analyze this destribution and plot its PDF . In the second part , a random process will be argued and the Expectation function and Auto correlation function will be calculated and plotted . and finally in the last part we are going to simulate a digital communication channel .

# PART 1 ( Rayliegh destribution )

After some estimations The PDF of 3 random variables ( X , Y , Z ) are plotted in MATLAB :

Setting the value of N 1000 , we ought to generate 3 arrays of random variables ( using randn function for normal destribution ) and plot them :

And now , the 3 previous plots with the N = 100000 :

Here are the value of the mean and variance of 2 different Ns :

N = 1000  : m = 1.2804  ,  var = 0.4078    ;    N = 100000  :   m = 1.2520  ,  var = 0.4285

It is clear that if the value of N is increased , the histogram would get closer to the PDF .
